QtStuff
==========

QtStuff is a python package for working with the PySide/PyQt packages. 
It aims to be a toolkit for making it easy to develop high quality GUI's. 

There are various recipes for PySide and PyQt kicking around the web, with many that
are extremely useful (or just cool). Unfortunately, there is no one resource to gather
and formalise these tidbits of code. 
QtStuff aims to fill that gap.
